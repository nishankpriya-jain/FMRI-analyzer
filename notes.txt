   -Functional Magnetic resonance imaging(FMRI)is a non-invasive technique for studyin brain activity.
      [invasive=>(of medical procedures) involving the introduction of instruments or other objects into the body or body cavities]
   
   -During FMRI experiment aseries of brain images are acquired while the subject performs a set of tasks.
   -Set of tasks is repeated a number of times so that we can observe with greater precisions.
   -Each Image consists of voxels(approx 10,0,000)
   -each voxel corresponds to a spatioal location and has a number associated with it.
   -tracking the intensity over time gives us a time series
   -There are different times series obtains:-
         BOLD(Blood Oxyenattion level dependent) fmri:-
		   It is the most common approach towards fMRI.
           It measures the ratio of oxygenated to deoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood		   
		   It doesn't measure neuronal activity directly,instead it masures the metabolic demands(oxygen consumption) of active neurons.
		   HRF(hemodynamic response function) represents changes in the fMRI signal triggered by neuronal activity.
		   
    -fmri data analysis is a massive data problem:
                 -each brain volume=1,00,000 voxel measurements.
                 -each experiment consists of hundreds of brain volume 				 
                 -each experiment may be repeated for multiple subjects.
	-fMRI Statistical Analysis:-
           -data is massive
		   -the signal if interest is weeak
		   -the data exhibits a complicated temporal and spatial noise structure.
		      Spatial resolution of an fMRI study refers to how well it discriminates between nearby locations.
			  Temporal resolution is the smallest time period of neural activity reliably separated out by fMRI
    
    -DATA Analysis:-
          	1)localizing brain activity
			2)Connectivity:
			    how different brsin regions are connected to each other. 
			3)Prediction:
			    use a person's brain activity to predict their perceptions,behavior,or health status.

   -During a fMRI experiment a balance between spatial reolution and temporal resolution needs to be established.
     Temporal Resolution(TR) is determined by how  quickly each individual image in acquired.
	 Spatial Reolution(SR) determines  our ability to distinguish changes in an image across different spatial locations.
	   
	 Terminology:
	 
	Structural Image(T1):
            -high spatial resolution
            -low temporal resolution
            -can distinguish different types of tissue.
 	Functional Imae(T2*):
            -lower spatial resolution
			-higher temporal resolution
			-can relate changes insignal to an experimental manipulation
			
    Coronal Slice:
           Slice along the line connecting the ears and perpendicular to thee direction of the nose.
    Sagittal Slice:
            Slice along the direction of the nose.
    Axial Slice:
           Slice along the line connecting the ears and parallel to thee direction of the nose.
    
    Generalling axial slices are used to form the 3D model which we analyse.
	
	fMRI Data:
	    Each voxel has a corresponding time series.

   Forward Inference:
          Given an induced psychological state -------> we observe brain activity
   Reverse Inference:
           can we infer psychological state <------- Given brain activity     
    **Applying Byes Rule for reverse inference

	Brain Mapping in good for:
	  -Making inferences on the presence of activity,to either test a theory or charaterize the pattern of brain response to a task.
	  -limiting the false positive rate to a specified lelvel
	  -Leverage hypothesis to provide evidence on a variety of theories like (is area a is involved in tast t).
	Brain mapping in not good for:
      -Reverse inference:
		-does not provide direcct ingerences about psychological states.
		-need good experimental designs,specialized analyses,meta-analyses.
      -Establishing meaningful effects:
        	 -terrible for estimating effect size and predictve accuracy.
	  -testing asumptions
	  -comparing evidence for different theories:
	        just because a model shows some effect it does not mean it's the best model

	Relaxation:
	  longitudinal relaxation (exponential growth described by time constant T1)//as original H+ will have longitudinal spin
	  transverse relaxation  (exponential decay described by time constant T2)
	   time constant=time to reach 63% of net magnetization
     longitudinal ralaxation time for  white matter,grey matter and csf (Cerebrospinal fluid)are 	 
    TR=>how often we excite the nuclei
    TE=>how soon after excitation we bein data collection
	T2* the combined effect of T2 and local inhomogeneities in the magnetic filed
	T2*=>is sensitive to flow and oxygenation ,it can be usedto uimage brain function

	process:
		-After the rf(radio frequency) pulse is removed the sytem seeks to return to equilibrium
		-During this process a signal is created that can be measured using reciver coil
		
	  -The measured signal combines information from the whole brain.
      -A magnetic field gradient is used to sequentially control the spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic field.	  
	  
	  -the measurements are acquired in the frequency domain(k-space).
	  -by making measurements for multiple values of(kx,ky) we can gain enough information to solve the inverse problem(we can use inverse fourier transform) and reconstruct row(x,y)
	  
	  -as in practice data measurements are made discretely over a finite region(we need to use discrete fourier transforms)
	  -the no. of k-space measurements we make influences the spatial resolution of the image.
    
     - Methods to acquire k space measurements:
	    -EPI
	    -Spirals
	 -Measured k-space data is complex in nature
     -Typically we work with magnitude images.
	 
        	 Inverse Fourier Transform
     k-space------------------------->image space
     
	          Fourier Transform
	 *image space---------------> k-space  	 
	
module-7 k-space:
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI5frNsRTI4&list=PLcvMDPDk-dSmTBejANv7kY2mFo1ni_gkA&index=8&spfreload=5
	-there is no one to one relationship between image anf k-space.
	-all the points in k-space contain information about different voxels.
	 Thus each individual point in image space depends on all of the points i k-space.
	-Low spatial frequencies represent parts of the object that change in a spatially slow manner (Contrast).
	-High spatial frequencies represent small structures whose size is on thee same order as the voxel size (Tissue boundaries).
